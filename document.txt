## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Why use social media for your conference?

So you're the organisers of the biggest conference in [insert field here]!

## 2. Platforms

### 2.1. Twitter

#### 2.1.1. Jargon

##### Tweet

A 140-character update posted to Twitter.

##### Mention (@)

You can use the at symbol to tag other Twitter accounts. If I wanted to tag the [CMS Experiment at CERN](http://cern.ch/cms) in my tweet, I could say:
> Today I went nearly 100 metres underground to see the [@CMSexperiment](https://twitter.com/CMSexperiment)!

##### Hashtag

A form of tagging to provide context to your tweets. A Word or a PhraseWithoutSpaces preceeded by the hash sign (#). So:

> Today I went nearly 100 metres underground to see the [@CMSexperiment](https://twitter.com/CMSexperiment)! [#LHC](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23LHC) [#unnecessaryhashtags](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23unnecessaryhashtag) [#superfluoushashtag](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23superfluoushashtag) [#justalongtagiamusingasahashtagforreasons](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23justalongtagiamusingasahashtagforreasons)

##### Re-tweet (RT)

A re-tweet is when you share someone else's tweet with your followers. Typically, you would click on the "re-tweet" button. However, you can also copy the content of the tweet and share it as an update of your own; to do so with the above tweet, you would say:

> RT [@RaoOfPhysics](https://twitter.com/RaoOfPhysics): Today I went nearly 100 metres underground to see the [@CMSexperiment](https://twitter.com/CMSexperiment)! [#LHC](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23LHC) [#unnecessaryhashtags](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23unnecessaryhashtag) [#superfluoushashtag](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23superfluoushashtag) [#justalongwordiamusingas](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23jjustalongwordiamusingas)

You will notice, though, that the last hashtag there is truncated: you've used too many characters. You therefore decide to delete that entire hashtag, or reduce "metres" to simply "m", or modify my original tweet in some way. Which brings us toâ€¦

##### Modified tweet (MT)

It is common courtesy that if you modify someone's tweet, you acknowledge it by using MT instead of RT:

> MT [@RaoOfPhysics](https://twitter.com/RaoOfPhysics): Today I went nearly 100 metres underground to see the [@CMSexperiment](https://twitter.com/CMSexperiment)! [#LHC](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23LHC) [#unnecessaryhashtags](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23unnecessaryhashtag) [#superfluoushashtag](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23superfluoushashtag)


##### Heard through / Hat tip (HT)

If you've come across a link or some information via someone, it's good practice to mention this in your tweet:

> I learnt that [@CMSexperiment](http://twitter.com/CMSexperiment) at [@CERN](https://twitter.com/CERN) is located nearly 100 metres underground! HT [@RaoOfPhysics](https://twitter.com/RaoOfPhysics)
