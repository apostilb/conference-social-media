# Social Media for Academic Conferences

## Published on apostilb

This repository was created to house content that once resided at [https://www.penflip.com/RaoOfPhysics/social-media-for-academic-conferences](https://www.penflip.com/RaoOfPhysics/social-media-for-academic-conferences).
Unfortunately, it looks like Penflip is no longer being updated.
It was therefore decided to migrate the text over to [apostilb](https://apostilb.github.io).
